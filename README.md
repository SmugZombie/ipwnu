# ipwnu
Toolset created for demonstrating why not to allow "allow_url_include" to be enabled

While this toolset could theoretically be combined into a single file. I left it split apart to allow beginners a chance to see how each file works individually.

Note: While you do see http://ipwnu.com listed throughout this project we do not own this domain, nor want to purchase it as a "premium domain" as it's currently listed. We used this domain as an example by hosting it on the same box as our vulnerable web app, in addition to modifying the host file on that box so that it knew what ip to go to so it could fetch the toolkit. If you do not wish to use the toolkit this way, you can host the files on a domain / ip you have access to and just find/replace the domain name listed above.
